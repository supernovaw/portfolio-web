      Hello, my name is <span title="Russian: Дмитрий Сигида (Dmitry Sigida)">Dmytro</span>.
      I am a self taught programmer. Here, I've collected some of my most remarkable works since
      the start of my programming journey in late 2016, when I was eleven. I made my first money off of
      programming when I was 15 (in 2020). I've spent most time coding in Java, recently switching to
      JavaScript to develop websites using ReactJS.
    </div>
    <div>
      I enjoy learning and I never plan to stop. I'm currently learning Python, I want to learn C, C++
      and Rust. Besides programming I also love learning languages, I'm learning Japanese and Ukrainian.

        I wanted to get a step closer to understanding how my favourite game worked. I had
        no idea what a GPU even does, so it was very slow on a CPU in 1 thread. However,
        I could already move and look around a couple of hardcoded objects in 3 dimensions.
        I couldn't find the source code from this screenshot.

        One day, I came up with an idea of how to compare kanji (Chinese/Japanese characters).
        I was frightened by the seeming complexity of such a task, but I gave my idea a try,
        and, surprisingly to me, it did work. I managed to create a recognition algorithm for
        written kanji. As of 2022, computer vision, AI and image recognition still remain like
        a gloomy forest to me. The algorithm I came up with is much simpler than alphabetic
        scripts recognition due to the fact that kanji have a fixed number, order and direction
        of strokes, and that they are written in real time, allowing the algorithm to know the
        order and directions of strokes. Each stroke is compared 1-by-1 along with differences
        in stroke positions for each character with the same number of strokes. An answer is
        considered correct if the most similar kanji in the database is the one that user was
        asked to write. Also, because I made it for a kanji-learning program, I did not need
        to attempt interpreting wrongly written characters. I get a lot of credit when I tell
        people about it, but it always feels to me that they overestimate the difficulty of the
        task I accomplished.

        I made this before the next item of this portfolio, which required an algorithm for
        consequently traversing every line in a picture. I did not aim for an efficient solution,
        all I needed was to avoid looping over the same lines too many times. However, it was
        still pretty complicated to make, and I was really happy when I got it to work.

        This, so far, is probably the most fascinating-looking program I've made, thanks to the
        beauty of mathematics which I was keen on at the time. Any looped 2D trajectory of any
        complexity can be represented using epicycles which give more and more precision. That
        concept is essential for audio compression and much more. This program processes any
        shape (which can be derived from a drawn image automatically using the program above)
        and builds a chain of epicycles, whose number can be dynamically changed, affecting the
        accuracy of the resulting trail.

        This is the program I've developed with most passion. It uses the recognition algorithm
        from a project I've made earlier, with much more focus on user interface. It was still
        a couple years before I had realised how important frameworks are for serious applications.
        Back then, I was wanting to develop everything on my own from scratch, only using built-in
        Java runtime libraries. And so I made an element structure with OOP that was displayed
        within Java's Swing framework, which I needed to get access to basic graphics operations
        and event listeners. I came up with how to program transition animations on properties
        like colour that are triggered on hover, for example. I even made a text field class where
        I did my best to implement caret navigation and typing. It did later help me realise how
        wasteful it is to ignore already existing frameworks that can take care of countless things,
        such as keyboard input & layouts, HiDPI, system themes, RTL, animations and optimisation.
        However it did look special and personal, just the way I liked in a lot of ways, and I'm
        still happy I made it, though I wouldn't do it again.

        I've spent almost the entire 2020 tracking what I spend my time on, for what I've developed
        a program. It represents everything on a timeline that can be zoomed in and out to any level.
        It allowed me to see exactly how I spent my days. I was really obsessed with managing my time,
        and by the end of the year I gave up on it because the pressure I was putting on myself was
        not helping. But I still like that idea and I'm planning to reimplement it in a React web
        application to continue doing it to strive for the least time spent on semiconscious and
        self-harming behaviour.

        Through lucky circumstances, I was invited to work on a couple of Android projects when I was

        data about fields. Shown on the screenshots is viewing and creating (marking) fields atop

        I was thinking a lot about my few year-old ideas about filtering an output image to create an
        illusion of the screen being constantly pointer at the viewer. I finally implemented them in
        October 2021. The setup should ideally require good 3D tracking devices, anaglyph glasses and
        a giant display (probably a white wall and a projector). I didn't have any of that, so I only
        made more of a "proof of concept." In order to track the viewer's location, I made an Android
        application (on the same phone on which the video was recorded) to track its rotation. The
        calculations assumed that the distance between the centre of the screen and the camera is
        constant, as well as the camera being pointed at the screen. It was the easiest to get
        approximate phone location this way, but of course it wasn't very accurate, and I didn't even
        have a flat screen, Wi-Fi delay was also a factor. However I still enjoyed it very much. I'm
        not that good with math anymore as it was more of a temporary hobby that I don't do so much now.

        This one is not so complex, it just was a lot of pain with CSS. I've made this app to go through
        all of my photos, compressed with different levels of quality to see where I want to preserve
        more detail and where to save more space. I ended up decreasing the total size of my gallery
        by a factor of a dozen or two (given poor initial compression).
